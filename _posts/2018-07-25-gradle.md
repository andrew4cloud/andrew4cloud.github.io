In this post i will be briefing about gradle & installation & configuration

Lets get started!!!

## Gradle

  Gradle is an open-source build automation tool focused on flexibility and performance. Gradle build scripts are written using a Groovy or Kotlin DSL

  Gradle supports many major IDEs, including Android Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio 2017, and XCode. You can also invoke Gradle via its command line interface in your terminal or through your continuous integration server. Gradle build scans help you understand build results, improve build performance, and collaborate to fix problems faster.

### Features of Gradle

  --> Highly customizable — Gradle is modeled in a way that customizable and extensible in the most fundamental ways.

  --> Fast — Gradle completes tasks quickly by reusing outputs from previous executions, processing only inputs that changed, and executing tasks in parallel.

  --> Powerful — Gradle is the official build tool for Android, and comes with support for many popular languages and technologies.

### How to install & configure Gradle

Prerequisites

Gradle runs on all major operating systems and requires only a Java JDK version 7 or higher to run. To check, run java -version. You should see something like this:

  {% highlight ruby %}
  ❯ java -version
  java version "1.8.0_151"
  Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_151-b12)
  Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.151-b12, mixed mode)
  {% endhighlight %}

Step-1 : If Java is not installed, then install

  {% highlight ruby %}
  sudo yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk wget unzip

  then check version

  java -version

  {% endhighlight %}

Step-2 :  Download Gradle

  Gradle distribution archive comes in two types: "binary-only" and "complete". The "binary-only" archive contains the Gradle software only wheres "complete" archive comes with binary, documentation and source. Run the following command to download Gradle to your system.

  {% highlight ruby %}
  wget https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-3.4.1-bin.zip
  {% endhighlight %}

Step-3 : Install Gradle

  Create a directory for the Gradle installation & Extract the downloaded archive to the newly created directory.

  {% highlight ruby %}
  ❯ mkdir /opt/gradle
  ❯ unzip -d /opt/gradle gradle-4.9-bin.zip
  ❯ ls /opt/gradle/gradle-4.9
  LICENSE  NOTICE  bin  getting-started.html  init.d  lib  media

  {% endhighlight %}

Step-4 : Configure your PATH environment variable to include the bin directory of the unzipped distribution, e.g.:

  {% highlight ruby %}
  export PATH=$PATH:/opt/gradle/gradle-4.9/bin
  {% endhighlight %}

Step-5 : Verify installation

  Open a console (or a Windows command prompt) and run gradle -v to run gradle and display the version, e.g.:

    {% highlight ruby %}
          ❯ gradle -v

        ------------------------------------------------------------
        Gradle 4.9
        ------------------------------------------------------------

        Groovy:       2.4.12
        Ant:          Apache Ant(TM) version 1.9.9 compiled on February 2 2017

## Creating New Gradle Builds

  First lets initialize the project

      {% highlight ruby %}
        ❯ mkdir basic-demo
        ❯ cd basic-demo
     {% endhighlight %}

 Now we can use Gradle’s init command to generate a simple project. We will explore everything that is generated so you know exactly what’s going on.

      {% highlight ruby %}
        ❯ gradle init
        Starting a Gradle Daemon (subsequent builds will be faster)

        BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 3s
        2 actionable tasks: 2 executed
      {% endhighlight %}

  The command should show "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" and generate the following "empty" project. If it doesn’t, please ensure that Gradle is installed properly, and that you have the JAVA_HOME environment variable set correctly.

This is what Gradle generated for you.

        {% highlight ruby %}

      (2)  Gradle Wrapper executable JAR

      (4)  Gradle Wrapper script for Unix-based systems
      (5)  Gradle Wrapper script for Windows

  Boom! Roasted. We could just end the guide here, Lets get started by creating simple build tasks

##  Create a task

    Gradle provides APIs for creating and configuring tasks through a Groovy or Kotlin-based DSL. A Project includes a collection of Tasks, each of which performs some basic operation.

    Gradle comes with a library of tasks that you can configure in your own projects. For example, there is a core type called Copy, which copies files from one location to another. The Copy task is very useful (see the documentation for details), but here, once again, let’s keep it simple. Perform the following steps:

Step-1: Inside your project directory create src  and myfile.txt inside that

    {% highlight ruby %}
      [root@ip-172-31-26-233 src]# ls
      myfile.txt  myfile1.txt
      [root@ip-172-31-26-233 src]#
    {% endhighlight %}


Step-2: Define a task called copy of type Copy (note the capital letter) in your build file that copies the src directory to a new directory called dest. (You don’t have to create the dest directory — the task will do it for you.)

    Once you initialize your projects gradle init

    {% highlight ruby %}
          [root@ip-172-31-26-233 basic-demo1]# gradle init

      > Task :init SKIPPED
      The build file 'build.gradle.kts' already exists. Skipping build initialization.

      BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 4s
      [root@ip-172-31-26-233 basic-demo1]#
    {% endhighlight %}

      {% highlight ruby %}
            [root@ip-172-31-26-233 basic-demo1]# ll
        total 28
        -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  237 Jul 25 13:09 basic-demo-1.0.zip
        -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  526 Jul 25 13:16 build.gradle.kts
        drwxr-xr-x 2 root root   58 Jul 25 13:13 dest
        drwxr-xr-x 3 root root   21 Jul 25 03:07 gradle
        -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 5296 Jul 25 03:07 gradlew
        -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2260 Jul 25 03:07 gradlew.bat
        -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  358 Jul 25 03:07 settings.gradle.kts
        drwxr-xr-x 2 root root   43 Jul 25 13:02 src
        drwxr-xr-x 2 root root   21 Jul 25 13:12 test1
        -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  114 Jul 25 13:16 test1.zip
        [root@ip-172-31-26-233 basic-demo1]#
        {% endhighlight %}

Step-3 : Add the below tasks in build.gradle.kts

        {% highlight ruby %}
          tasks.create<Copy>("copy") {
              description = "Copies sources to the dest directory"
              group = "Custom"

              from("src")
              into("dest")
          }

        {% endhighlight %}

Step-4 : Now execute your new copy task:

          {% highlight ruby %}
          [root@ip-172-31-26-233 basic-demo1]# ./gradlew copy

          BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
          1 actionable task: 1 up-to-date
          [root@ip-172-31-26-233 basic-demo1]#
          [root@ip-172-31-26-233 basic-demo1]#
          [root@ip-172-31-26-233 basic-demo1]# cd dest;ls
          abc.txt  myfile.txt  myfile1.txt
          [root@ip-172-31-26-233 dest]#
          {% endhighlight %}
